This homemade garlic-infused oil is an easy way to add a garlic flavor to dishes or to make a garlic [[mayonaise]]. It's also an good way to add garlic flavor to dishes for folks with FODMAP sensitivities since it has garlic essense, but no actual garlic.

# Ingredients

* 1/2 cup oil
* 2 cloves garlic

I recommend a neutral oil like canola, but olive oil is also a good choice if you want to use this in Italian dishes.

# Steps

1. Finely mince the garlic
2. Put the oil in a small pan, heat on low heat
3. Immediately add the garlic to the pan
4. Stir occasionally, cooking until the garlic turns golden brown. Be careful to not burn the garlic.
5. Pour the oil through a fine mesh strainer to remove the garlic
