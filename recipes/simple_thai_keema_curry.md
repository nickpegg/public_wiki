Source: https://myheartbeets.com/thai-ground-beef-curry/

# Ingredients

- 1 onion, chopped
- 1 tbsp neutral oil
- 1 pound ground beef
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 inch knob of ginger, minced (equal in volume to garlic)
- 2 tsp curry powder
- 1 tsp cumin
- 2 tbsp red curry paste
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 giant handful of Thai basil
- 1 tbsp chili oil (rayu maybe?)
- 2 tsp fresh lime juice
- salt and pepper to taste

# Steps

1. Heat skillet over medium heat, add neutral oil and onion. Add some salt and pepper.
2. Once onion starts browning, add garlic, ginger, curry powder, cumin, salt, black pepper, and ground beef. Cook until beef is browned through.
3. Stir in red curry paste
4. Cook for a minute, then add tomato sauce, fish sauce, chili oil, and thai basil
5. Simmer on low for 10-15 minute so that the ingredients get to make friends and the sauce thickens
6. Add the lime juice and serve with rice

# Notes

- When I made the source recipe:
	- I had to add a lot more red curry paste. I ended up at least doubling, if not tripling it.
	- I also added curry powder in addition to the tumeric, probably 2 tsp
	- I ended up using 2 tbsp of this chili olive oil I had. Added a nice spice, but tasted too "Italian." Should use a different kind of chili oil - rayu maybe?
