If you have an immersion or stick blender, homemade mayo is super easy to make!

## Ingredients

|Qty     | Thing |
|--------|-------|
| 1      | egg
| 1      | egg yolk
| 1 tsp  | ground mustard
| 1/4 tsp | salt
| 1 tbsp | lemon juice
| 1 tsp  | vinegar - white, or apple cider
| 1 cup | neutral oil - like canola


## Steps

1. Take eggs out of fridge and let them get to room temperature
2. Find a jar that your stick blender can fit in that's at least 2 cups in size
3. Put non-oil ingredients into the bottom of the jar
4. Drizzle oil on top of the other ingredients. It should stay pretty separated.
5. Slowly lower stick blender until it's sitting on the bottom of the jar, on top of the egg
6. Turn on stick blender, let it sit on the bottom for 5 seconds. It will start mixing egg with oil to make an emulsion
7. With the blender still running, slowly pull it up to the top and let it mix more oil into the emulsion
8. You're done! Grab a spoon and scrape the mayo out of the blender. Also give the mayo in the jar a stir to make sure all the ingredients are mixed in together

You probably want to eat this within a week, maybe two weeks at most. There's raw eggs in there, and nothing to really preserve it besides the acid from the lemon juice and vinegar.


## Variations

* **Spicy mayo** - substitute 1 tbsp of neutral oil with 1 tbsp of rayu (chili-infused sesame oil). 
	* Rayu can be found in the Asian section in the supermarket next to the other sesame oils. You want the kind without anything in it, it often can be found with crispy garlic - which is delicious! But not what we want here.
	* If you don't see it, it's sometimes labeled "La-yu" or even just "hot pepper sesame oil."
* **Garlic mayo** - Replace the neutral oil with garlic-infused oil
* **Kewpie knockoff** - The secret to this Japanese brand of mayo is supposedly apple cider vinegar, so use that instead of white vinegar



# Iteration Log

## Attempt 1 - spicy mayo
* Tried replacing 1 tsp of netural oil with rayu to make spicy mayo. Not enough! Need 1 tbsp
* Was pretty thin, should use 1 egg + 1 egg yolk

The flavor was really good! This mayo has a good kick to it.

## Attempt 2 - plain mayo
Used apple cider vinegar, to try to emulate Kewpie mayo. The recipe I found said 1 tbsp of vinegar, or I thought it did at least. That was _way_ too much vinegar!! I found another recipe that said 1 tsp, which sounds better.

## Attempt 3 - garlic mayo
Made garlic oil:
- 1/4 cup oil
- 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
- Heat in a pan over low heat until garlic is golden brown
- Pour oil through fine mesh strainer to remove the garlic

Used 1/4 cup garlic oil and 1/4 cup canola oil

I thought that the garlic was too subtle at first, but after a day in the fridge it was actually the right amount.
