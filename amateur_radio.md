## Stores
### Online
- [DX Engineering](https://www.dxengineering.com/)
- [Gigaparts](https://www.gigaparts.com/)
- [Ham Radio Outlet](https://www.hamradio.com/)
	- Has physical stores, the (now closed) one in Oakland had some pretty bad reviews due to assholes working there. Maybe avoid unless they have a really really good deal.
- [Universal Radio](https://www.universal-radio.com/)
	- Old-school site, seems to be entirely sold out. Has a bunch of historical info

### SF Bay Area


## Digital Modes

- [WSPR](http://www.wsprnet.org/drupal/) - propagation reporting beacons
- [FT8](https://www.sigidwiki.com/wiki/FT8) - mostly automated contact-making and signal checking
- [PSK31](https://www.qsl.net/sv1grb/psk31.htm) - digital rag-chew
- AX.25 packet radio - BBSes and stuff!


## Equipment ideas
### Antennas
- [EARCHI end-fed](http://www.earchi.org/proj_homebrew.html) - $56
	- 6-40m, 30 foot wire
	- Requires antenna tuner
- Les has a 68ft OCF dipole he’s willing to lend for science
- [Comet CHA-250B](https://www.hamradio.com/detail.cfm?pid=H0-007756) - $380
	- Vertical multiband 6 - 80m, “plug and play”
	- Comes with hardware to mount to a pole, could fashion a roof stand out of metal or PVC
- [Buddipole](https://www.buddipole.com/buddipole.html) - adjustable to a whole lot of bands, 2m down to 40m, up to 250W
	- [Overview](https://ve3ips.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/a_brief_guide_to_the_buddipole_system_revn.pdf) of the system
	- reviews are poor, say it’s finnicky and narrow bandwidth
- mag loop anteanna - expensive!

### Transceivers
- [QDX](https://www.qrp-labs.com/qdx.html) - all USB controlled, HF only, **$65**
	- USB CAT control, USB audio
- [QRPGuys AFP-FSK](https://qrpguys.com/qrpguys-digital-fsk-transceiver-iii) - $80
	- No USB interface, knobs for tuning and jacks for audio
	- Different filter boards for different bands, comes with 20m, 30m, 40m, must build others
- FT-991a - mother of all transceivers, HF 160m to 10m, 6m, 2m, 70cm. $1200
	- built-in antenna tuner
- IC-7300 - similar to FT-991a, more user-friendly, no 2m/70cm, $1200
- My current VX-7R is **mostly receive-only**, since it can do AM and 6m but **can’t transmit modes like FT8 since it can’t do SSB**
