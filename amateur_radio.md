# Stores
## Online
- [DX Engineering](https://www.dxengineering.com/)
- [Gigaparts](https://www.gigaparts.com/)
- [Ham Radio Outlet](https://www.hamradio.com/)
	- Has physical stores, the (now closed) one in Oakland had some pretty bad reviews due to assholes working there. Maybe avoid unless they have a really really good deal.
- [Universal Radio](https://www.universal-radio.com/)
	- Old-school site, seems to be entirely sold out. Has a bunch of historical info

## SF Bay Area
