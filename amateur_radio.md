My amateur radio notes

# My Setup
* Base transceiver is a Yaesu FT-991a
- Diamond MR77 mobile antenna for 2m/70cm, stuck to one of my filing cabinets
- EARCHI end-fed antenna for HF/6m, currently mounted to the picture rails in my home office

When remote, I have a Yaesu VX-7R with a Signal Stick antenna

# TODO

# Stores
## Online

- [Gigaparts](https://www.gigaparts.com/)
- [Ham Radio Outlet](https://www.hamradio.com/)
	- Has physical stores, the (now closed) one in Oakland had some pretty bad reviews due to assholes working there. Maybe avoid unless they have a really really good deal.
- [Universal Radio](https://www.universal-radio.com/)
	- Old-school site, seems to be entirely sold out. Has a bunch of historical info
