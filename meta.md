# Meta

I use [Obisidian](https://obsidian.md/) to edit this wiki. Instead of paying them for site publishing, I publish using my own tooling (soon to be open sourced)

## TODO
- [x] Write a basic tool to convert Obsidian Markdown to HTML
- [ ] Open-source the publish tool
- [x] HTML template with CSS for wiki
- [x] Hosting on my server or a GCS bucket
- [ ] fix wonky styling on [[test/styles]]
- [ ] GitHub Action to publish to the bucket
